There is an acute shortage of health care in smaller towns and villages. The objective is to scale up of the existing telemedicine /call centre for doctors network to all subcentres using DTH or similar technology that allows two way communication and is not dependant on Internet Service Providers. All data to be held in a cloud server, Integrating cloud tech with Patient MIS and Aadhar authentication, in order to make it easy for patients belonging to low socio economic and educational backgrounds for safe keeping of medical records and also for accessing the databases by emergency medical technicians by merely using biometric / thumb impressions.

Our Approach to the problem statement can be broken down into 3 critical sections:

A) Generation of a cloud based electronic health record system, implementing aadhar authentication.
B) Access to medical records and database for medical professionals using Biometric/Facial ID, for emergencies and diagnostic purposes.
C) Telemedicine/ Call Centre setup for doctors implementing DTH or 2 way communication technology without being dependent on ISP
